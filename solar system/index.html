		<p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. The largest of such objects are the eight planets, in order from the Sun: four terrestrial planets named Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, two gas giants named Jupiter and Saturn, and two ice giants named Uranus and Neptune. The terrestrial planets have a definite surface and are mostly made of rock and metal. The gas giants are mostly made of hydrogen and helium, while the ice giants are mostly made of 'volatile' substances such as water, ammonia, and methane. In some texts, these terrestrial and giant planets are called the inner Solar System and outer Solar System planets respectively.</p>

	<h3 id="sun_">SUN</h3>
	<div class="intro">
		<p>he Sun, at the center of the Solar System, is a massive ball of hot, glowing gas primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It provides the gravitational force that keeps all other objects within the Solar System in orbit. The Sun's energy is generated through nuclear fusion at its core and is responsible for providing light, heat, and energy to all the planets and other bodies in its gravitational grasp.</p>

		<h4 id="mercury_">Mercury</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<img id="mercury" src="https://pngimg.com/d/mars_planet_PNG31.png">
			<p class="mer">Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and is known for its extreme temperature variations due to its lack of atmosphere. It has a heavily cratered surface and a relatively large iron core.</p>
		</div>
		<h4 id="venus_">Venus</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<p>Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. However, its thick atmosphere traps heat, making it the hottest planet in the Solar System.</p>
			<img id="venus" src="https://www.pngall.com/wp-content/uploads/11/Venus-PNG-Clipart.png">
		</div>
		<h4 id="earth_">Earth</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<img id="earth" src="https://assets.stickpng.com/images/5a00de530e8525eec2752fff.png">
			<p class="er">Earth is the only known planet to support life. It has a diverse range of ecosystems and is characterized by its oceans, atmosphere, and abundant water.</p>
		</div>
		<h4 id="mars_">Mars</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<p>Mars, often called the "Red Planet," has surface features reminiscent of both Earth and the Moon. It's home to the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons, and the vast Valles Marineris canyon system.</p>

		</div>
		<h4 id="jupiter_">Jupiter</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<img id="jupiter" src="https://www.transparentpng.com/thumb/jupiter/jupiter-cut-out-png-4.png">
			<p>Jupiter is the largest planet and is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It has a strong magnetic field, a prominent system of rings, and over 70 known moons, including the four Galilean moons</p>
		</div>
		<h4 id="saturn_">Saturn</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<p>Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, which is composed of ice and rock particles. It is also home to a diverse group of moons, with Titan being the second-largest moon in the Solar System.</p>
			<img id="saturn" src="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/011/178/727/original/saturn-on-space-background-elements-of-this-image-furnished-by-nasa-free-png.png">
		</div>
		<h4 id="uranus_">Uranus</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<img id="uranus" src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2021/04/05/15/54/uranus-6153865_1280.png">
			<p>Uranus is unique for its extreme tilt, causing it to essentially rotate on its side. It has a bluish color due to its atmosphere's composition of methane.</p>
		</div>
		<h4 id="neptune_">Neptune</h4>
		<div class="intro">
			<p>Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun and is known for its striking blue coloration. It has a turbulent atmosphere and the strongest winds in the Solar System.</p>
